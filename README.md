# CS 31
CS 31 is Introduction to Computer Science I (in C++), which I took under Professor Howard Stahl in Winter of 2017. I have included 4 projects. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to showcase my skills in C++. My grades for 4 of the projects are as follows:


|   Assignment  | Grade  |
----------------|--------
| Project 1     | 100% |
| Project 4     | 87% |
| Project 6     | 100% |
| Project 7     | 100% |

# CS 31
CS 31 is Introduction to Computer Science I (in C++), which I took under Professor Howard Stahl in Winter of 2017. I have included only 3 projects, because I cannot find where I have saved the other 4 projects :'(. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to showcase my skills in C++. My grades for 3 of the projects are as follows:


|   Assignment  | Grade  |
----------------|--------
| Project 1     | 100% |
| Project 4     | 87% |
| Project 7     | 100% |
